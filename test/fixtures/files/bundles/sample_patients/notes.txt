Included are 3 curated patient sets generated by Synthea. TXT included alongside FHIR for ease of reading.
Note that these are based on multiple runs, and Synthea doesn't have the concept of "families" so these were manually aggregated by birth date. We will probably want to tweak names, addresses, and race/ethnicity for consistency.
